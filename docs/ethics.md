# ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

## Overview

CareerCompanion AI is designed with ethical principles in mind, though as an open-source project in development, these are goals we're working toward rather than fully implemented features.

## Core Principles

### 1. Human Control
- All generated applications require human review before submission
- The system assists but doesn't make decisions for you
- You maintain full control over what gets sent

### 2. Transparency
- Open source code for full visibility
- Clear documentation of what the system does
- No hidden algorithms or black box decisions

### 3. Privacy
- All data stored locally on your machine
- No tracking or analytics
- API keys and personal information never shared

### 4. Fair Use
- Respects rate limits on all platforms
- Follows robots.txt and terms of service
- No attempt to bypass security measures

## Bias Considerations

While we aim to reduce bias, the system currently:
- Filters based on objective criteria (location, keywords, etc.)
- Does not collect or use demographic data
- May inherit biases from the underlying LLMs used

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Systematic bias testing not yet implemented
- No formal fairness metrics currently measured
- Community review needed for bias identification

## Data Handling

### What We Store
- Job listings (locally)
- Application history (locally)
- Your configuration preferences (locally)

### What We Don't Store
- Personal identifying information on external servers
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- Application success/failure rates

## Responsible Use Guidelines

### Do:
- Review all generated content before sending
- Customize templates to be authentic
- Use rate limiting to respect platforms
- Report issues or concerns via GitHub

### Don't:
- Use for spam or mass applications without review
- Attempt to bypass anti-scraping measures
- Misrepresent your qualifications
- Violate terms of service of job platforms

## Limitations & Disclaimers

1. **No Guarantee of Results:** This tool assists with job search tasks but doesn't guarantee interviews or offers
2. **LLM Limitations:** Generated content may have errors or biases from the underlying models
3. **Platform Changes:** Web scraping may break when sites update
4. **Legal Compliance:** Users responsible for ensuring compliance with local laws

## Future Goals

We aspire to implement:
- Formal bias testing framework
- Audit trails for transparency
- Better documentation of AI decisions
- Community-driven ethical guidelines
