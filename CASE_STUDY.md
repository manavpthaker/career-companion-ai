```python
class VendorAgnosticLLMRouter:
    """Route requests to optimal model based on task requirements."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            'reasoning': {'primary': 'claude-sonnet', 'fallback': 'gpt-4'},
            'creativity': {'primary': 'claude-opus', 'fallback': 'gpt-4-turbo'},
            'cost_sensitive': {'primary': 'llama-3-70b', 'fallback': 'claude-haiku'},
            'safety_critical': {'primary': 'anthropic-safeguard', 'fallback': 'openai-moderation'}
        }
        
    def route_request(self, task_type: str, content: str) -> ModelResponse:
        """Intelligent routing with automatic fallback and cost optimization."""
        model_config = self.models.get(task_type, self.models['reasoning'])
        
        try:
            return self._execute_with_monitoring(model_config['primary'], content)
        except (APIError, RateLimitError):
            return self._execute_with_monitoring(model_config['fallback'], content)
```

**Business Impact:**

        self.global_patterns = {}  # Aggregated insights (no PII)
        
    def contribute_learning(self, user_id: str, outcomes: Dict):
        """Contribute anonymized learning to global knowledge."""
        anonymized = self.anonymize_outcomes(outcomes)
        differential_private = self.add_noise(anonymized, epsilon=1.0)
        self.update_global_patterns(differential_private)
        
    def get_personalized_insights(self, user_id: str) -> Insights:
        """Combine personal history with privacy-preserving global patterns."""
        personal = self.local_models.get(user_id, {})
        global_safe = self.get_privacy_safe_patterns()
